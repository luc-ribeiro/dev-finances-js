## ðŸ’» Project
This project was created during Rocketseat's Discovery marathon.

Financial control application developed by Mayk Brito during the Discover Marathon offered by Rocketseat.
The application's goal is to facilitate people's financial control in a simple and fast way.
All data about expenses and earnings are saved in the browser's Local Storage, so once the page is refreshed, the entered data will not be lost.
